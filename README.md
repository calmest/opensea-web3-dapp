# opensea-web3-dapp
OpenSea Blockchain Web 3.0 App with Next.js
---------------------------------------------

I styled it using TAILWIND CSS.

This App is built using web3 technologies.

I created a marketplace on the blockchain where NFTs are minted and NFT collections are made.

THIRDWEBSDK is the technology used to buy the created and listed NFTs.

METAMASK is used for authentication.

SANITY.IO is used as the database backend to store users and owners information.

The Frontend is built and the data is upadated on the NFT and collection pages using THIRDWEB on the blockchain.

GROQ (Graph, Relational, Object, Query) and the SANITY API is used to retrieve data.

The ETHEREUM is the chain that this app is built upon.

This app is deployed and hosted on VERCEL.
